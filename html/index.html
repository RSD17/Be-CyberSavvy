                    <p>Hi! I'm Ritayush, a 16-year-old student from India. I have been programming for over 6 years and developed 100+ projects throughout my learning journey. I created this website to help people understand the importance of cyber security and digital responsibility. I have always been intrigued by these topics and I strongly believe that as technological innovation continues, keeping oneself and others safe remain pivotal towards ensuring true field progress.
