        <h2>What is Biometric Encryption?</h2>
        <p>Biometric encryption is a way of protecting sensitive information by using unique biological traits like your fingerprint, face scan, or iris pattern. Instead of saving the actual picture of your fingerprint or face, the system converts it into a special encrypted code (like a secret digital lock). This means that even if hackers steal the data, they can’t recreate your fingerprint or face.</p>

        <h2>Why is it helpful?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Stronger Security:</b> Unlike passwords, which can be guessed, stolen, or shared, biometric data is unique to each person.</li>
            <li><b>User-Friendly:</b> People don’t need to remember long, complicated passwords.</li>
            <li><b>Protection from Identity Theft:</b> Even if someone tries to hack a database, the biometric data is stored as encrypted codes, not actual images. This makes it much harder to misuse.</li>
            <li><b>Future-Proof:</b> As cyber threats grow, biometric encryption is becoming one of the most trusted methods for protecting personal devices, banking apps, and even government records.</li>

        <h2>Apple Face ID (2017-present)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Apple introduced Face ID in the iPhone X, which uses biometric encryption.</li>
            <li>When you set up Face ID, your facial features are scanned and converted into a mathematical model stored securely on the device’s “Secure Enclave.”</li>
            <li>The actual image of your face is never uploaded to Apple’s servers, and it is never shared with apps.</li>
            <li>This means even if someone hacked Apple’s main systems, your personal facial data wouldn’t be exposed.</li>
            <li>Apple’s use of encrypted biometrics has since influenced the wider smartphone industry, with many companies adopting similar security measures.</li>
